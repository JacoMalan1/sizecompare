#How the size measuring was done.

This section is all about how the sizes were measured and how you should
use them.

The **T-shirts.**
Firstly I measured the arms lengths. This was measured from the middle of the chest, to the tip of the arm and then I doubled the length I measured to get the final measurement.
The waist was measured from side to side.
I measured the length from top to bottom and wrote the raw value as the final measurement.

The **pants.**
I measured the waist from side to side, nothing funny.
I measured the length from top to bottom, also nothing funny.

How to use these sizes.
The application is called _Size Compare_ for a reason. That reason being, that you don't get the perfect measurement you have to compare the sizes and find the clothing size that are the nearest to your own length.

Now the most important thing you need to know is that these sizes were measured in **South-Africa**, and may not be the same in other countries.
