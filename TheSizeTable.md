#The table with the basic content of the app.

This table took a few long painstaking days in Woolworths and Edgars.
These are the two main South-African shops that my app contains sizes of.

The table is the main source of information in the app it gives all of the sizes(7-16 years old, for now) and lengths of the clothes.

The table is yet to be expanded but in this short period of time that the app needed to be finished it will only contain the basic children sizes.
