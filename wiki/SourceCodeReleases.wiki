#I explain my source release method

=Introduction=
In this wiki page I will explain *when I release my source code*, *That I only release parts of it* and *why I do that.*

=Source code release times=
I release my source code whenever I feel that I have created source code that could be useful and that it could be used for other 
applications (NOTE that I make it clear in the copyright notice that I do not guarantee that it will be fit for a specific purpose).
=Partial source code releases=
I only release parts of the source code for basically the same reason that I mentioned in the paragraph above.
=That reason more _In debth_=
I only release parts of my source code because not all of my source code is fit for any purpose except this project. Most of my source code has been split up into many different classes with the only purpose that it can be kept organized. The consequence is that it's no longer fit for any other purpose. On the other hand there is some of my source code that can be used for other projects. That part of the source code will be the parts that load the configuration files and setup all of the buttons etc.

=Conclusion=
I hope that clears everything out and makes you understand the reason in what I do and how I do it.
